Going through the code has brought up the fact that currently pc / npc
races within the world need some tweaking editing, there are a lot
of remnants. In order to help builders in creating it would be nice
to fix this problem and tailor the existing races to actually fit with 
our mud. 

Races I would like to remove:

bear
arachnid                
snake
undead
vampiremist
worm
hydra
lizard
werewolf        
goblin
faerie
troll
orc
giant
ogre
minotaur
hobgoblin


These are the races I propose:
Malandrin
Cvin
Rehan
Jlen
El'Cvin
Immloean
Ximmerin
Insect
Dragon
Animal
Potential
Corpse (to replace undead)
Spirit
Elemental
Bat
Plant
Rodent
Object
Fish
Horse
Bird
Reptile
Canine
Feline
Mammal
