<p>
The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/strivemud/" target="cmain">strive site</a> is designed to hold a
collection of all strive documentation.  This will ensure that EVERYONE has
access to ALL documentation ALL the time.  To use this site effectively, I
have designed this simple help page to explain how things work.

<table border="0">
<tr>
        <td width="80">STEP 1</td>
        <td><hr>First of all, make sure you have read the 
        <a href="/strivemud/current/naming.html" target="cmain">
        naming convention page</a>.  
        All documentation placed on the site must follow these naming 
        standards so that we can be easily aware of what is what.
        <hr> 
        </td>
</tr>
<tr>
        <td width="80">STEP 2</td>
        <td>Having named your document appropriately, you now need to 
        upload it to the strive web site.  There are two ways to do this, 
        the first is to use ftp (<a href="ftp://ftp.geocities.com/">ftp.geocities.com</a>).
        <br><br>  
        The second is through the geocities file manager. Go to 
        <a href="http://www.geocities.com" target="cmain">www.geocities.com</a> and log on.                             Then choose the file manager, and open the file manager.  Now you can choose a          
        directory and upload your files. 
        <hr>
        </td>
</tr>
<tr>
        <td width="80">STEP 3</td>
        <td>Having uploaded your file, you now have two options,
        you can either edit the 
        <a href="/strivemud/current/updates.html" target="cmain">
        update history</a> page and the 
        <a href="/strivemud/current/proposals.html" target="cmain">
        unresolved proposals</a> page yourself.<br><br>
        Or if you are not 
        confident working with html, you can email me and ask me to update 
        the history pages which I will happily do. If you choose to edit 
        the history pages yourself, please try and make sure you stick to 
        the format used for those pages. 
        <hr>

<p>
The <a href="/strivemud/current/history.html" target="cmain">history page</a> is a central page through which imms can view what is currently going on, and navigate to the appropriate area.  If any of this is confusing, please ask, I would hate to think this system would not be used after the effort I have put in.
