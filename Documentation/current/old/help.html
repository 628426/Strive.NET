<p>
The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/strivemud/">strive site</a> is designed to hold a
collection of all strive documentation.  This will ensure that EVERYONE has
access to ALL documentation ALL the time.  To use this site effectively, I
have designed this simple help page to explain how things work.
</p>

<pre>
STEP 1  First of all, make sure you have read the <a href="/strivemud/current/naming.html">naming convention page</a>.  
        All documentation placed on the site must follow these naming 
        standards so that we can be easily aware of what is what. 
</pre>
<pre>
STEP 2  So, having named your document appropriately, you now need to 
        upload it to the strive web site.  There are two ways to do this, 
        the first is to use ftp (<a href="ftp://ftp.geocities.com/">ftp.geocities.com</a>).
  
        The second is through the geocities file manager. Go to 
        <a href="http://www.geocities.com">www.geocities.com</a> and log on.  Then choose the file manager, 
        and open the file manager.  Now you can choose a directory 
        and upload your files. 
</pre>
<pre>
STEP 3  Having uploaded your file, you now have two options, you can
        either edit the <a href="/strivemud/current/naming.html">history page</a> yourself, or if you are not 
        confident working with html, you can email me and ask me to update 
        the history page which I will happily do. If you choose to edit 
        the history page yourself, please try and make sure you stick to 
        the format used throughout the page. You will probably  have to 
        download a copy of the history page and edit it on your computer, 
        before uploading it again.
</pre>
<br>
<p>
The <a href="/strivemud/current/naming.html">history page</a> provides a list by date of uploads / changes to the strive documentation web site, as well as providing a list of ALL approved documentation. This page is meant to act as a central page by which imms can view what is currently going on, and navigate to the appropriate area.  If any of this is confusing, please ask, I would hate to think this system would not be used after the effort I have put in.
