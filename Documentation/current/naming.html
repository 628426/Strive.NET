<p><b>Naming conventions are as follows:</b></p>

<p>If you are uploading a file for approval you need to include your name as a suffix of the documents name when you upload it to the appropriate directory.</p> 

<p>File names should not contain spaces.</p>

<p>File names should be in title case, that is the first letter of a new word should be capitalised. </p>

<p>e.g. I upload a map of CoraLyst to the /strivemud/maps/CoraLyst/ directory. I would call it CoraLystMapIsrejin.</p>

<p>If Tim were to now upload his suggestion for the map he would call it CoraLystMapDantra.</p>

<p>Approved items are given the Approved suffix, so in this case it becomes CoraLystMapApproved.</p>
