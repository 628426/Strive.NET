The Approved List of Month Names for the Mud.

The following is based on the idea of a 12 month year, virtually identical to the month system in place for our real life calendar.  That was the general consensus from the vague discussion which took place, as far as I was aware.

Add a "The Month of..." before each one for more style :)

Month 1  - Rebirth               (Spring)
Month 2  - Wanderlust
Month 3  - Fool-Wrought Pleasure
Month 4  - Heat Uprising         (Summer)
Month 5  - Bloodwatch
Month 6  - Cloven Fire
Month 7  - Star Touched Dreaming (Autumn)
Month 8  - Coruscating Shadows
Month 9  - Storms
Month 10 - Ice's Call            (Winter)
Month 11 - Sirens Touch
Month 12 - Fates Entwined
