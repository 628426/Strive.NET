This is once again the case of a detail that I have in my head but has
not been officially released as part of the world. 

A long time ago, the rehan had another language, which is now called
"Ancient Rehan". It is not commonly spoke these days, though the
occasional scholar may know more then his or her fair share of it.
Some words and phrases remain however, and are to this day commonly 
used.

Common prefixes you should know:

Cora: City
Il: Great (Il'Cora = Great City)
Ru: Town
J: Small Village (e.g. J'Greth)
Ior: Lake (e.g. Ior'Ckar)
Falsta: Forrest / Woods
El: Bad/Dark/Tainted (Cvin == True Bloods, El'Cvin == Bad or Tainted Bloods)
Seth: Nobility

Other quirks:  Seth'o'par (the 'o' means upper, the upper noble house Par )
                      Ior't'Ckar (the 't' means lower, the lower Ckar Lake)

This isnt comprehensive, but these are the commonly used items from the ancient
rehan language that have stuck, and are kind of like common words in the everyday
of today. Cora'Tyl isnt the ancient rehan translation of the City of Tyl, it is
the cities name: Cora'Tyl. Im sure there will be more of these common terms
in the future.
