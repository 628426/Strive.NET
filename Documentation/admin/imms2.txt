This is my view of the current immortal status and roles.

Directors - Dantra, Isrejin.
Coding - Dantra, Isrejin, Michael.
Building - Verrin, Isrejin and Thaan.
Natural Philosophy - Fiory, Michael, Darion, Isrejin.
Game Systems - Isrejin, Fiory, Michael.
Atmosphere - Fiory, Michael, Wookash.
Storyline - Fiory.


"Directors" is self-explanatory.

"Coding" covers two things: bug hunting and coding new things. Isrejin is
currently handling the bug hunting. Tim, when he gets back online, will be
doing both, as will I if I ever get the time to get the concurrent versioning
system up and working.

"Building" - Verrin is in charge, but apparently buried alive by real life.
Isrejin and Thaan are among the builders, both working on Cora'Lyst. I don't
know the current builder roster, but I assume Armeli is on it and I hope 
Teraysha will be soon.

"Atmosphere" is basically tactical roleplay and preemptive FP spying. It's
what Wookash signed up for. I'm mostly mucking about with the Academy and
its' denizens.

"Natural Philosophy" is how the world of Lu'Tamohr works - flora, fauna,
weather, history, geography, peoples, places, herb lore. 

"Game Systems" is how the game works. Death, rebirth, clan war, trade,
levelling, statistics, skills, specializations, spells. Note the 
heavy overlap with "natural philosophy".

"Storyline" - long-term, strategic roleplay, and the things that underpin
it.

As Isrejin says, everybody helps out everywhere as and when. There are people
I don't see very often, so there are inaccuracies.
