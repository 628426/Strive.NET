<p>
This is the main slist page and is designed to provide a few
explanations about how to use this system and also provide a
conceptually simple springboard into the previously unmanageable
skill list document.
</p>

<p>
On the left of the web page you will see a frame containing a number
of buttons. The main button refers to this page and you can return
here at any time. The <a href="/strivemud/skills/guidelines.html" target="main">guidelines</a> button will take you to a page 
explaining each of the fields used to classify skills. 
There is one other page you should have a look at before jumping into
the slist itself and that is the <a href="/strivemud/skills/extras.html" target="main">extras</a> page which contains extra details not mentioned 
specifically on the specialisation pages themselves.
</p>

<p>
The next five buttons will begin your journey into the slist itself.
The first button, Townsfolk, goes directly to the Townsfolk Skills page
where you can peruse the skills for Townsfolk and check off any you are
happy with.
</p>

<p>
The Labourer, Student, Soldier and Rogue buttons will take you to a table
of all the specialisations derived from them. From these tables you can
navigate deeper into the slist and actually look at and approve the
skills for each specialisation. Each of these tables comes with a submission
form also which allows you to check off each FULL specialisation you are
happy with. What this means is that you have read through the skills
of that specialisation and are happy with all of them. Rather then tick
off each individual skill, you can check off the specialisation here
and have the same effect.
</p>

<p>
Submissions are automatically emailed to me and once all imms have submitted
their ideas / opinions, updates etc can be made. I will make available
the output of these submissions during each round of approval.
