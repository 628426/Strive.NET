This is designed to be a start to the definition of skills for each 
of the specialisations. Obviously its not going to be right first time 
and will require us to balance the skills across the classes so that 
each class has an equal opportunity to be fun to play on the mud. So 
if you disagree with something, that is fine, use the forms to explain
your views, and submit them for interpretation. It is important that we 
get some form of slist for each class together, perhaps more important 
then anything else so that they can be coded.

Each skill has been ranked in the following categories:

<b>Duration</b>         Duration of the skills use.
<b>Use</b>                      Skills use.
<b>Syntax</b>                   How the skill is used
<b>Affect</b>                   What affect the skill has
<b>Skills it counteracts</b>    Skills it counters or nullifies
<b>Skills it compliments</b>    Skills it works in conjunction with

<b>Level restrictions</b>       Is there a level or some other type of 
                         restriction on the skills attainment?
<b>Major element</b>            Applicable to spells only, the element 
                         the attack is based on if any.

<b>Prerequisites</b>            Skills you need to be able to use and 
                         practice the skill.
<b>Practice Cost</b>            Cost to practice the skill along with 
                         the max you can practice it to and the 
                         maximum it can reach in terms of a percentage.

<b>Casting costs etc</b>        Cost to use the skill to the caster.
<b>Required Components</b>      Objects you need to be able to use the skill
<b>Starts Combat?</b>           Does using the skill initiate combat?
<b>Used during combat?</b>      Can you use this skill during combat?

The following are not done for each skill, but for each rank. See the

Leveling ability of class       For each class I have compared the 
                                leveling abilities they have across 
                                their rank.

Rank comparison                 This is my opinion based judgement 
                                of the  value of the specialization 
                                compared to other specialisations 
                                in the same rank.
