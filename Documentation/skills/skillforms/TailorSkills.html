                        could end up a random colour.

Sew                     Creates an item of clothing from a bolt of cloth

Duration                N/A
Use                     See above
Syntax                  Sew (raw material) (desired item)
Affect                  Can create a variety of items from simple raw 
                        materials. This would include various wear 
                        locations and allow the tailor to edit short, 
                        long and look at descs using colour if they wish.
        
                        I’m unsure exactly how to implement except to 
                        perhaps place items made by tailors in their own 
                        vnums and allow them to use a cut down version of 
                        oedit where they choose a wear location to make 
                        an item for and are created a default object for 
                        which they can edit the various descs. The name of 
                        the item should include the tailors name and 
                        likely the short desc. Tim or Verrin will likely 
                        have some more detailed ideas on how best to 
                        implement this.

                        class of the item increases by 50% If the clothing 
                        is not armour then it gains the affect of adding 2 
                        hit roll to the person who wears it.

Duration                N/A
Use                     See above
Syntax                  Remake (clothing item) (type of desc) (desc)
Affect                  Can rename basically any item made of 
                        appropriate materials i.e.

                        Remake (vest) long (desc) changes the long 
                        description

                        Remake (vest) short (desc) changes the short

                        look at description (ie extra desc)

                        The (vest) argument would have to be one of

Disguise                Mislead people as to your true identity.

Syntax                  Disguise (thing to change) (thing to change to)
Affect                  The disguise skill for tailors is not as powerful 
                        as that of a master thief or eluder. They are 
                        able to change their sex, change their race, and 
                        change their name to a name that does not already 
                        exist however. I don’t think they should be able 
                        to disguise as someone that already exists as the 
                        skills of imitation do not really apply to a tailor 
                        class.
