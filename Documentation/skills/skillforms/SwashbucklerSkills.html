                        rules as the first attack with the exception 
                        that the boundaries for a successful hit change.

                        With a single attack you have a 25% of missing totally, 
                        a 50% of hitting their armour and 25% chance of 
                        hitting and bypassing their armour.

                        The second attack would have a 35% chance of missing, 
                        a 50% chance of hitting their armour and a 15% chance 
                        of bypassing their armour. The third attack would 
                        have a 45% chance of missing, a 45% chance of hitting 
                        their armour and a 10% chance of bypassing their armour.

                        overrules theirs for a start and they are

Affect                  Disarming the target causes them to lose their

                        themselves but there is a lag associated of 1 
                        combat round above the lag for disarm so you 
                        get at least 1 free round of combat on them 
                        with them unarmed.
