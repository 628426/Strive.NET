                        mode, and your pemote is changed to reflect 
                        the fact you are working. Using the say 
                        command or trying to move etc takes you out 
                        of work mode. You can only work while you have 
                        the energy to work. Whilst working you lose 20 
                        energy per tick and do not regain energy each 
                        tick you are working.

                        This works out that a level 1 person with 500 energy 
                        can earn 50 gold coins in 25 ticks (just over 10 mins) 
                        before resting.
