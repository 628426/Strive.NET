eign Death             Allows the student to act as though they are 
                        already dead to avoid confrontation

Duration                N/A
Use                     See above
Syntax                  Feign Death
Affect                  In order for this to be useful we will need 
                        to change the way in which corpses are 
                        displayed. If the dead creature is an animal 
                        you see the corpse of an animal. If it is a 
                        certain race you see the corpse of that race 
                        so that when you feign death you become a 
                        corpse of the race you are. 

                        With this in mind feigning death will allow 
                        you to appear to be a corpse. Your short desc 
                        will change to "the corpse of a (race) lies here"
                        and your look at desc will be the same. Whilst 
                        you are feigning death you are aware of all that 
                        goes on in the room around you. As soon as you 
                        type a command like say or get or try to move 
                        you stop feigning death. You cannot be attacked 
                        while you are feigning death until revealed by 
                        the check pulse skill.
