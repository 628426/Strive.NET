<p>This page contains all the Merchant skills. When you have looked through all of the skills and selected the check boxes for skills you are happy with you should submit these along with your comments.</p>
<p>Obviously merchants and master merchants will get some skills designed to give them advantages in any trade system we implement once we implement it. This is something we will implement later on down the track.
</p>
<p>Remember, you should do at least one submission for EACH specialisation, including this one.</p>
