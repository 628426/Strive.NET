Conceal                 Can conceal small items and weapons about their 
                        person so that people are unaware of what they 
                        have gotten themselves into.

Duration                Until you unconceal an item 
Use                     As above
Syntax                  conceal (item)
                        unconceal
Affect                  This would work by hiding various items which 
                        you are wearing in various wear locations from 
                        people who look at you. They view you as though 
                        you are not wearing anything in that location. 
                        This obviously would only work for small items 
                        perhaps rings, weapons with small weights (like 
                        a dagger) and belts? Unconceal would return all 
                        concealed items to full view. Also when you 
                        enter combat all concealed items become visible.

                        you deal for that round is modified by doubling

Affect                  You can only hide in a city room or indoors. Hide 
                        is the basic form of hiding and a successful 
                        search will uncover your hiding spot. If you speak 
                        you are revealed, if you move you are revealed. 
                        If you do perform any action (unless it is stealthed 
                        somehow) you are revealed.

                        for hiding from someone or lying in wait, but you
                        would need the advanced hide skill to enter a room
                        with people and hide to listen to their conversaton.

Dirty Tactics           Rogues dont fight much, but when they do, they
                        dont fight fair.

Use                     See above
Syntax                  
Affect                  During combat, this skill has a chance of 
                        triggering and performing one of the following
                        actions:

                        Dirt Kick:      Blinds opponent for one round.
                        Trip:           Lags opponent for one round, they have
                                        to get up to continue fighting.
                        Cheap Shot:     Hit opponent in a painful position
                                        causes them to lose a round of attacks.
                        Bite:           Does some extra damage to opponent.

                                        causes them to lose their attacks until
                                        re-armed.

                        round of combat. For a dirty tactic to occur it must
                        first make the 30% then succeed in a check against
                        their proficiency in the skill. Finally they must make
                        any checks required by the individual dirty tactic they
                        are to employ.
