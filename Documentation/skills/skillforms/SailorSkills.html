Signaling               A brief set of signals using hand signs from 
                        1 room away

Duration                N/A
Use                     To inform others of certain things that are 
                        happening
Syntax                  Signal (direction) (command)
Affect                  We will need to come up with a list of signals 
                        we think appropriate and useful to the players. 
                        If you fail your signal the message you send 
                        in the direction you chose is nonsensical. 
                        Anyone in the target room with the signal skill 
                        can interpret a successful signal.
