Concentrate             Extra willpower for a duration which is very 
                        useful for reducing the damage done to you

Research                Can learn information about objects and mobs 
                        and rooms. You have to be in a special
                        library room (there will be one in each
                        major town or city) to use the skill.

Duration                N/A
Use                     To help learn something about people, places 
                        and things you know of.

Syntax                  Research (target area, object or mob)
Affect                  What research tells you will depend upon what 
                        it is you are researching.

                        Research (area)
                        Does research on the target area, this will 
                        tell you some details about the area such as
                        the level of the mobs that are in the area.
                        Maybe a shopkeeper list too.

                        Research (mob)
                        This will tell you the level of that mob as 
                        well as that mobs class, race and size.

                        Research (object)
                        This will tell you the value of that object 
                        and what type of object it is. It will also 
                        tell you the material that object is made 
                        out of.

                        Perhaps we will need a no_research flag on mobs, 
                        objects and rooms, though perhaps we will not 
                        need it.

Feign Death             Allows the student to act as though they are 
                        already dead to avoid confrontation

Duration                N/A
Use                     See above
Syntax                  Feign Death
Affect                  In order for this to be useful we will need 
                        to change the way in which corpses are 
                        displayed. If the dead creature is an animal 
                        you see the corpse of an animal. If it is a 
                        certain race you see the corpse of that race 
                        so that when you feign death you become a 
                        corpse of the race you are. 

                        With this in mind feigning death will allow 
                        you to appear to be a corpse. Your short desc 
                        will change to "the corpse of a (race) lies here"
                        and your look at desc will be the same. Whilst 
                        you are feigning death you are aware of all that 
                        goes on in the room around you. As soon as you 
                        type a command like say or get or try to move 
                        you stop feigning death. You cannot be attacked 
                        while you are feigning death until revealed by 
                        the check pulse skill.

Advanced Write          Can write books instead of just letters.

Duration                N/A
Use                     Instead of using the stories and epics 
                        board you can get your stories physically 
                        into the mud world.

Syntax                  write (book object) (number)
Affect                  This skill allows you to add multiple extra 
                        descriptions to appropriate objects in the 
                        mud, to a maximum of 10 extra descriptions. 
                        The number argument above is basically the 
                        extra description name, so to read a book 
                        written using advanced write we would type
