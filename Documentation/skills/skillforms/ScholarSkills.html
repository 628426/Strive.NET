                                then you can use it during combat but 
                                you can’t initiate concentration whilst 
                                fighting.

Affect                  I’m unsure how we could implement this but 
                        basically it’s so that scholars can find out 
                        the exact area where the book they wish is located. 
                        This may not even be useful, especially not
                         straight away, but it may be very important for 
                        roleplay later on down the track. (if we hide some 
                        ancient and informative texts around for example)

Advanced Research       Can learn useful and important info about 
                        objects, rooms and mobs. As with the research
			skill you must be in a special library room
			for the skill to work.

Duration                N/A
Use                     To help learn something about people, places 
                        and things.
Syntax                  Research (target room, object or mob)
Affect                  What advanced research tells you will depend upon 
                        what it is you are researching.
                
                        Research (room)
                        Does research on the target room, this will tell 
                        you what area you are currently in and the level 
                        of the mobs that are in this area. It will also 
                        tell you the sector type of the room, if there are 
                        any extra descriptions in the room and what they 
                        are, if there are any hidden doors in the room and 
                        where to find the keys for any locked doors 
                        within the room.
                                
                        Research (mob)
                        This will tell you the level of that mob as well as 
                        that mobs class, race and size. It will also tell 
                        you the mobs level, armour class, current hit points, 
                        max hit points, hit roll, cognition, strength,
                         constitution, willpower and any skills the mob has. 
                
                        Research (object)
                        This will tell you the value of that object and what 
                        type of object it is. It will also tell you the 
                        material that object is made out of. It will also 
                        tell you the weight of the object, any modifiers it 
                        has (e.g. damage modifiers or armour modifiers), and 
                        anything else I missed out.

                        If we have a no_research flag on rooms/objects/mobs 
                        this will only affect normal research, advanced 
                        research will tell you info about even no_research 
                        things.

Humble                  Scholars, vastly knowledgeable about the world 
                        and all things in it can humble even the most

Affect                  In order for humble to be successful you must 
                        do a cognition vs willpower roll. Compare a 
                        roll of the scholars cognition with the targets 
                        willpower roll for success. If successful the

                        their armour class is also halved for duration.
