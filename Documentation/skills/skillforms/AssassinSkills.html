Mark

                Choose a target, cannot assassinate anyone else until the chosen 
                mark is dead, but can attack that person even when not in a 
                warzone. That is if we implement warzones. If we dont implement
                warzones, then perhaps mark could work so that an assassin
                killing their marked target does not attract the attention
                of the guards as easily as someone else might. Depends how
                we implement the outlaw/consequences/punishment system.

Strangle

                An exotic weapon. This will would be it a lot nastier 
                than on DR - even with insanely buff nooses it was wimpy. 
                We will need some conditions on getting it off cause it 
                will be quite useful. Something like takes away 20% of 
                total hps from opponent each round, giving them 5
                rounds if fully healed to break free or subdue the
                assassin.

Anonymous Kill

                Over Info channel and the murdered player does not see 
                your name in death message. What would likely be better 
                though is if no deaths were announced over the info 
                channel and instead the skill worked by if you 
                assassinated someone (killed them in one round) the 
                person that was assassinated has no idea who it was that 
                killed them. They just become a ghost and see a "You have
                been killed" message with no indication as to who did it.

Mix Poison

                Using poison ingredients. This skill would be different 
                to the combine skill and allow the assassin to mix various 
                poisons. Perhaps we need to implement a system like DR 
                hereby assassins have to train each poison they can make 
                serperately. The most powerful and deadly poisons are
                created by alchemists however, even though an assassins
                poisons are pretty potent.

Apply Poison

                Can Apply poisons to weapons, food or drink.

Advanced Disguise

                Much better then normal disguse as assassins can imitate 
                people. You can disguise as existing players and as mobs 
                like DR disguise. You even take on their description if 
                they are a valid player or mob.

Harass

                Provide the assassin with an extra attack in combat
                due to their skill at overwhelming opponents.

Bypass

                Allows Assassins to bypass escort, advanced escort, 
                divert and rescue, to actually get in and kill the
                real object of their affection.

Lurk

                Searching does not uncover lurking. Assassins are also not 
                hit by room or area affects in such a way as to be revealed. 
                They still take the damage from area affects such as ice
                storm etc. Can lurk in any terrain except plains/fields. No
		message displayed when attempting to lurk.
