Seal Letter             Create a unique seal on a letter object based on 
                        the players name. 

Duration                N/A
Use                     So that letters sent have a unique seal, you know 
                        that if you see a certain seal the letter has 
                        remained unopened and is from that player.

Syntax                  Seal (appropriate letter object)
                        Seal (with no appropriate letter object sets the 
                        text to the seal description)
                        Open (sealed letter)

Affect                  The letter object will have its short, long and 
                        look at descriptions change based upon the players 
                        name and seal type.

                        i.e. Seal (Jeweled Sword)
                             Seal (Letter)
                        Will change the letter object to the following:
                        Long description: A sealed letter is here.
                        Short description: a sealed letter
                        Look at description: A letter sealed with the 
                        Jeweled Sword of Isrejin.
                        Breaking the seal returns the original descriptions 
                        to the object.                          

Skills it counteracts           None, you can still break a sealed letter 
                                and read it if you intercept it. But the 
                                seal is broken.

Swim                    Obviously not everyone has to train it, and it 
                        will only entitle people to swim in shallow water I 
                        should think. We certainly don’t want people just 
                        swimming across oceans.

Duration                It affects you in permanence
Use                     To move over certain water squares.

Syntax                  It’s a skill that is always in affect, so you don't 
                        initiate it with a command.

Affect                  Will be able to walk over and into squares that are 
                        flagged water_surface. So they won't be able to swim 
                        in squares flagged deep_water or underwater. This is 
                        something we will need to tell the builders.

Skills it counteracts           None
Skills it compliments           Skills you are required to be in water rooms 
                                to perform.

                                to 95% max

Casting costs etc               Costs double your energy to move using the swim 
                                skill (ie in water)

Starts Combat?                  No
Used During Combat?             Yes, to flee a fight in shallow water. Note that 
                                all fights conducted in water_surface should have 
                                severe restrictions on to hit and damage.

Dispose                 Allows you to get rid of corpses of animals or 
                        even humans without leaving a trace of them for 
                        others to find.

Duration                N/A
Use                     Remove corpses from cluttering up the room
Syntax                  Dispose (corpse)
Affect                  If a corpse is not disposed of it will stay there 
                        for quite a long time until it decays.
        
                        Why a dispose command? I think because the sacrifice 
                        command is too oriented towards sacrificing corpse 
                        to the gods and in a realistic sense this doesn’t 
                        get rid of all traces of a corpse anyway. We do need
                        some way of getting rid of corpses though or they 
                        will clutter up the mud as we have to face the fact 
                        that lots of mobs will die over the course of the mud. 
                        I would like it however if corpses stuck around until 
                        reboot or until they are disposed of.

                        This would not be a skill with a chance of failing.

Recognise Terrain       Just from entering the room you can identify 
                        what type of terrain you are in.

Duration                N/A
Use                     See Above
Syntax                  None
Affect                  Every time you do a look your recognise terrain 
                        is tested and if successful the type of terrain 
                        is displayed to you.

                        Perhaps also, recognise terrain works when you
                        cannot see also (blinded or its too dark).

Search                  You can search for people hidden in your room.

Duration                N/A
Use                     See above

Syntax                  Search
Affect                  Depending on how the person is hidden it will 
                        determine if you can find them using this skill.

                        The way this is proposed to work is that when
                        a player wishes to search the room, they initiate
                        the skill, and a message "Isrejin starts searching"
                        is displayed to all in the room. This gives any hidden
                        people a chance to escape undetected, otherwise they
                        are discovered depending on the skill they have used
                        to hide with, and if the search skill is successful.

Check Pulse             You can check a corpse to identify if it is 
                        still alive.

Duration                N/A
Use                     To expose people using the feign death command, 
                        unless they are found out using this skill they 
                        are pretty much undetectable.

Syntax                  Check (target corpse)
Affect                  This will reveal any corpses that are actually 
                        still alive (those using feign death).

                        There are some problems with this and feign death
                        but also solutions. I am sure the problems can be
                        worked out if we want these two skills, otherwise
                        we dont need to work them out.

Build Fire              Anyone should be able to build a fire so long 
                        as they have a flint and tinderbox. Fires light 
                        up darkened rooms and can only be built outdoors. 
                        They cannot be built when the weather is rainy. 
                        They enable you to sleep more comfortably or at 
                        all.

Duration                Dependent on weather, and raw materials used in 
                        the fire.

                        If its rainy any fire you build will last for half
			the duration listed below.
                        If its overcast your fire duration is 3/4
                        If its clear your fire duration is normal
                        
                        For each piece of lumber used in the fire to 
                        create it the fire stays for 2 hours based upon 
                        the current game time we have. If our game 
                        time changes so will this have to.

                        If no lumber is used to start the fire then it lasts
                        for 1 hour, explained by the gathering of twigs / 
                        branches etc.

Syntax                  Build Fire <number of pieces of lumber>

Affect                  Creates a fire object in the room:
                        If 0-1 piece of lumber spent the fire is a small fire
                        If 2 -4 pieces of lumber spent the fire is a 
                        If 4-6 pieces of lumber spent the fire is a large fire
                        > 8 pieces spent the fire is a roaring fire

                        If you use the build fire command in a room where 
                        a fire already exists it will add the lumber you enter 
                        to the current fire.

                        What I would also like to propose is that we have a 
                        temperature system associated with our weather system. 
                        If the weather is cold and there is no fire built, 
                        then players should not be able to sleep outdoors.

                        The way I would like fires to work in terms of healing
                        rates is as follows:

                        Healing rate sleeping indoors = normal
                        Healing rate sleeping indoors with a fire= +50%
                        Healing rate sleeping outdoors = half
                        Healing rate sleeping outdoors with a fire = normal
			Healing rate sleeping outdoors in rain 25% or normal

Cook                    So long as there is a fire in the room you can turn 
                        raw food stuffs into edible food.

Duration                N/A
Syntax                  Cook (target corpse)

Affect                  I think we should remove the whole arms, turds and guts
                        objects from existence entirely, and instead when
                        someone dies they leave a corpse and some raw meat items
                        that can be cooked. Either this of you use a "butcher"
                        skill to turn a corpse into a bunch of cookable 
                        components.

Mount                   Allows you to ride mountable mobs.

Duration                Until you dismount
Use                     Allows you to mount animals that can be mounted
Syntax                  Mount (target)
                        Dismount

Affect                  Mounting an animal allows you to move using its 
                        energy instead of your own for movement. Failing 
                        to mount or dismount an animal causes you a 
                        small amount of damage (5% of your current hps). 
                        If you are attacked or attack someone while mounted 
                        you immediately dismount if you do not have the 
                        mounted combat skill.

Butcher                 Allows you to turn non-sentient corpses into raw food.

Duration                N/A
Use                     See Above
Syntax                  Butcher <target corpse>
                        
Affect                  Perhaps depending on the race of the corpse, a different
                        number / type of raw food items are created. These can
                        then be cooked over a fire.

Combat Basics           This allows you to use the stance command. You must 
                        train each stance individually however.

Duration                None
Use                     To give you the edge and to provide variation in 
                        combat by allowing you to use stances.

Syntax                  stance (stance type)
Affect                  You can use the stance command. If you fail you 
                        just fail to assume that stance for fighting and 
                        retain your current stance. This would only have 
                        an affect if you want to try and change your 
                        stance whilst fighting using a more powerful skill.

                        Note also that this skill gives you access to use
                        the passive and normal stances.

                                for combat.
