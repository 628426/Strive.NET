Affect                  Can perform three attacks per round. The chance 
                        of success of the third attack follows the same 
                        rules as the first attack with the exception 
                        that the boundaries for a successful hit change.

                        a 50% of hitting their armour and 25% chance of 
                        hitting and bypassing their armour.

                        The second attack would have a 35% chance of missing, 
                        a 50% chance of hitting their armour and a 15% chance 
                        of bypassing their armour. The third attack would 
                        have a 45% chance of missing, a 45% chance of hitting 
                        their armour and a 10% chance of bypassing their armour.

Affect                  Parry skill comes into affect when it has been 
                        determined that they have hit you. You have an 
                        equal chance of parrying each of your opponents 
                        attacks, I would suggest about a 50% chance.

Use                     See Above
Syntax                  Iron Grip
Affect                  You cannot be disarmed while you have an iron grip 
                        on your weapon, but placing that grip on your 
                        weapon requires both concentration and strength so 
                        you lose 2 willpower and 2 strength whilst you 
                        have an iron grip on a weapon.
