Legend Lore             Can learn information about objects and mobs 
                        and rooms

Use                     To help learn something about people, places 
                        and things you know of.

Syntax                  Lore (target room, object or mob)
Affect                  What legend lore tells you will depend upon what 
                        it is you are trying to discover info about.

                        Lore (room)
                        Does research on the target room, this will 
                        tell you what area you are currently in and 
                        the level of the mobs that are in this area.

                        Lore (mob)
                        This will tell you the level of that mob as 
                        well as that mobs class, race and size.

                        Lore (object)
                        This will tell you the value of that object 
                        and what type of object it is. It will also 
                        tell you the material that object is made 
                        out of.

                        Perhaps we will need a no_research flag on mobs, 
                        objects and rooms, though perhaps we will not 
                        need it.
