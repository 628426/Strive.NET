Warfare                         

                Allows the champion to alter their stance whilst fighting
                to counter act a situation. I.e. switch from patience
                to counter attack based on their opponents stance.
		They can also recognise what stance an opponents is in and
		use that to their advantage.

Dual Wield

                parry and the number of attacks they get by 1. Not quite 
                as good offensively as two handed bonuses, but better
                defensively.
