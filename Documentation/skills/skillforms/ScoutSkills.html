Advanced Camouflage     Allows you to blend in well with your 
                        environment and avoid being seen.

Duration                Level hours
Use                     Hide in a room
Syntax                  Camouflage
Affect                  You can only camouflage in an outdoor room 
                        (includes, forests, hills etc). Advanced 
                        Camouflage is the advanced form of hiding 
                        outdoors, but can be searched for. If you 
			speak you are revealed, if you move you are 
			revealed. If you do perform any action 
			(unless it is stealthed somehow) you are 
			revealed.

			Advanced camouflage has an advantage over
			the normal camouflage skill because you can
			camouflage yourself without displaying a
			message to those in the room.

                        are camouflaged. You can even detect

Horsemanship

Duration                Until you dismount
Use                     Allows you to mount animals that can be 
                        mounted but with greater skill then most people

Syntax                  Mount (target)
                        Dismount
Affect                  Mounting an animal allows you to move using 
                        its energy instead of your own for movement. 
                        Failing to mount or dismount an animal causes you 
                        a small amount of damage (5% of your current hps). 

                        If you are attacked or attack someone while mounted 
                        using advanced mount you do not immediately 
                        dismount, instead you can fight from horseback 
                        which gives you +2 to your dex roll and increases 
                        your strength modifier for damage by 50%.

                        Mounts mounted by the advanced mount command cannot 
                        be blocked by the bandit skill and can also jump 
                        farmers fences. 

                        Mounts are and can be attracted by various bard 
                        and druid skills as they are normal animals.
