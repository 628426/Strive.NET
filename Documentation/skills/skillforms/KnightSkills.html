Warfare                         

                Allows the knight to alter their stance whilst fighting
                to counter act a situation. I.e. switch from patience
                to counter attack based on their opponents stance.
		They can also recognise what stance an opponents is in and
		use that to their advantage.

Armour Mastery

                Serves two functions, knights can wear armour that 
                weighs more then anyone else  such as plate mail (we 
                will need to work out our armour class weights / 
                modifiers)  plus their armour class is increased by 50% 
                (we will likely need some sort of max armour class).

Mounted Combat
        
                Can fight from horseback. Mounted combat defeats all 
                stances and provides some advantages to the knight. To 
                unhorse the knight you will have to kill his/her mount 
                first. Perhaps mount also attacks opponent too.

Escort

                Basically an advanced form of rescue. Any person who 
                is being escorted and is the target of an attack has 
                that attack redirected to the knight instead. I.e. 
                the knight starts fighting and you are safe.

Combat Mastery

                Through mastery of the art of combat the knight can
                see more openings and react more effectively hence
                affording him an extra attack each combat round. This
                would be his/her 4th attack.
