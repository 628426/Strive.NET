<b>Note:</b> Many storm sworder skills cannot be invoked if you are wearing armour with an armour class value of greater then 100. This is because storm sworders must be light and mobile to perform their numerous devastating attacks.

Primal Rage             When a storm sworder successfully kills an 
                        opponent they gain dam roll pluses dependant 
                        on enemy’s level.

Duration                Each primal rage has a duration of 1 hour 
                        for every 20 levels.

Use                     Grow stronger as you sink into a killing frenzy.
Syntax                  None
Affect                  What I suggest is that each time you kill an 
                        enemy and primal rage is successful you get an 
                        affect added to your affects list of x dam roll. 
                        X is dependant upon the level of the opponent 
                        you just killed compared against your own level 
                        rounded up. I would suggest it is only possible 
                        to have 5 primal rage affects at one time.

                        If the opponent is 20 levels or more below you, 
                        you gain no dam roll bonus or primal rage flag.
                        If the opponent is between 10 and 20 levels below 
                        you, you gain 1 dam roll bonus.
                        If the opponent between 1 and 10 levels below 
                        you, you gain 2 dam roll bonus.
                        If the opponent is your level or less then 5 
                        levels higher then you, you gain 3 dam roll bonus.      
                        If the opponent is 5 or greater levels higher 
                        then you, you gain 4 dam roll bonus.

			Whilst in such a state you can ONLY kill opponents
			you cannot incapacitate them, so you must seriously
			consider the consequences.

Ferocity                Hurting a storm sworder only makes them a more 
                        formidable enemy to subdue.

Duration                1 hour for every 10 levels
Use                     To gain combat advantage
Syntax                  None
Affect                  When a storm sworder is dealt damage they receive 
                        pluses to their dam roll for a duration. I would 
                        suggest for every 100 damage dealt to them they 
                        gain 1 dam roll. With maximum player hit points 
                        going to be around 2000 or less this would only 
                        be plus 20 dam roll. Still quite useful. The affect 
                        is cumulative, so each time 100 hit points of 
                        damage is dealt to them they gain an extra dam roll 
                        in their affects and the duration is reset to 1 
                        hour for every 10 levels.
                        Of course for each 100 hps you regain from a healing 
                        spell you lose 1 dam roll from this affect as well.

Fury Rush               Not to be confused with the fury stance, fury
                        rush is when a storm sworder charges deep 
                        into battle, and is caught up in the tumult 
                        that ensues.

Affect                  With this skill in use, storm sworders cannot 
                        flee from battle and they automatically lose 
                        their dexterity comparison in the avoidance 
                        phase. What they gain however is 1 hit roll 
                        for every 10 levels and 1 dam roll for every 
                        10 levels.
