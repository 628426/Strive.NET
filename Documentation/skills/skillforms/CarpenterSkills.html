Build Fence             Fences stop things from passing through easily.

Duration                Until destroyed somehow (or reboot)
Use                     Stop mobs primarily from entering or exiting 
                        certain rooms.

Syntax                  Build Fence (direction) 
Affect                  This would create a fence in the specified 
                        direction and that fence would be mirrored of 
                        course in the next room (ie if you build a 
                        fence north a fence will appear in the room 1 
                        north of you built to the south). Fences would 
                        prevent mobs in particular from passing.

                        I have two ideas for the way in which fences could 
                        work, the first is that fences can be opened (to 
                        simulate a gate or just plain climbing the fence) 
                        so that players can pass fences. 

                        The second is to have the fence be a mob which can’t 
                        hit you and with a fair amount of hit points that 
                        blocks in the specified direction. You have to destroy 
                        the fence to get past. Not sure which is the best 
                        option.

                        Fences would require 4 pieces of lumber to build and 
                        can only be built outdoors.

Carve                   Create simple wooden objects that cannot be worn.

Duration                Permanent
Use                     Create items that will enhance rp, and can be sold
Syntax                  carve (short desc) (long desc) 
Affect                  Creates a wooden item with a short and long desc 
                        as specified. These items would be takeable and 
                        unable to be worn.

Construct Building      Allow carpenters to create new buildings from 
                        scratch using a horde of raw materials. The imms 
                        reserve the right to condemn any building unfit 
                        for the Lu’Tamohr world.

Duration                Permanent
Use                     Create houses etc for players 
Syntax                  Construct Building
Affect                  If the builder has in their possession (or their 
                        room) enough raw materials (about 20 pieces of 
                        lumber for each room they wish to build in the 
                        house with a maximum of 5 rooms to a house) they
                        are granted builder access to the specified 
                        number of rooms within the builders playpen. This 
                        will require Tim coding something that allows 
                        people with builders commands only the ability 
                        to edit vnums they have been authorized to edit 
                        (and in this case only redit). When the builder 
                        has finished the house they will have to notify 
                        the imms that they wish to place the house in 
                        play. The imms (probably verrin) will have a 
                        look at the house to decide if it fits in with 
                        the world and copy it (we will need a copy command) 
                        or maybe just link it to an appropriate place in 
                        the real world.
                                
                        If you fail your construct building skill check 
                        all your raw materials are lost and you do not 
                        get granted access to the playpen. Rather then the 
                        playpen we may need an actual separate are just for 
                        players houses.

                        We may need to code it so that you can’t redit 
                        during combat, I know I abused that on DR (sheepish 
                        grin).

Syntax                  Build Door (direction) 
Affect                  Very similar to build fence, but you can build 
                        doors inside.

                        Doors would require 4 pieces of lumber to build 
                        and can only be built inside.

Repair Door             requires lumber and repairs a broken door

Duration                N/A
Use                     Repairs broken doors
Syntax                  Repair Door (direction) 
Affect                  Perhaps this skill is not applicable. So 
                        far I have not suggested a bash door skill 
                        at all because I don’t like people bashing 
                        down doors willy nilly. However it is 
                        realistic, perhaps bash door should be a 
                        townsfolk skill that you can only use if 
                        your strength is above a certain number so 
                        that strong people can bash down doors and 
                        make the repair door skill useful?
