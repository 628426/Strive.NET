Build Fence             Fences stop things from passing through easily.

Duration                Until destroyed somehow (or reboot)
Use                     Stop mobs primarily from entering or exiting 
                        certain rooms.

Syntax                  Build Fence (direction) 
Affect                  This would create a fence in the specified 
                        direction and that fence would be mirrored of 
                        course in the next room (ie if you build a 
                        fence north a fence will appear in the room 1 
                        north of you built to the south). Fences would 
                        prevent mobs in particular from passing.

                        I have two ideas for the way in which fences could 
                        work, the first is that fences can be opened (to 
                        simulate a gate or just plain climbing the fence) 
                        so that players can pass fences. 

                        The second is to have the fence be a mob which can’t 
                        hit you and with a fair amount of hit points that 
                        blocks in the specified direction. You have to destroy 
                        the fence to get past. Not sure which is the best 
                        option.

                        Fences would require 4 pieces of lumber to build and 
                        can only be built outdoors.

Horsemanship

Duration                Until you dismount
Use                     Allows you to mount animals that can be 
                        mounted but with greater skill then most people

Syntax                  Mount (target)
                        Dismount
Affect                  Mounting an animal allows you to move using 
                        its energy instead of your own for movement. 
                        Failing to mount or dismount an animal causes you 
                        a small amount of damage (5% of your current hps). 

                        If you are attacked or attack someone while mounted 
                        using advanced mount you do not immediately 
                        dismount, instead you can fight from horseback 
                        which gives you +2 to your dex roll and increases 
                        your strength modifier for damage by 50%.

                        Mounts mounted by the advanced mount command cannot 
                        be blocked by the bandit skill and can also jump 
                        farmers fences. 

                        Mounts are and can be attracted by various bard 
                        and druid skills as they are normal animals.

Stampede                Charges animals in a direction, causing much 
                        damage to anyone in the way

Duration                N/A
Use                     See above
Syntax                  Stampede (direction)
Affect                  Stampede takes every animal mob in the farmers 
                        room and charges them in the specified direction 
                        for 10 squares. If the mobs reach a dead end 
                        they choose a random exit from the choices and 
                        continue the stampede until they have either gone 
                        10 squares or can not leave the room they are in. 

                        Each mob in a stampede has a chance to hit each 
                        player/mob in a room as they stampede. Stampeding 
                        mobs do their level in damage if they manage to hit 
                        (some form of dex roll needed).
