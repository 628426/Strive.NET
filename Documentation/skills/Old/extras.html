Weapon Types:

We have several damage types at present they are:
hit     slice   stab    slash   whip    claw    blast   pound   crush   
grep    bite    pierce  suction chop    vorpal  cleave   wail               

What I propose is that we split these weapon damage types into the 
following weapon type categories. The reason I think we need to do 
this is that anyone with enough strength to pick up any type of weapon 
an use that weapon in combat, but only a person who has done some 
training in the use of that type of weapon can actually make any use 
of the weapon.

I would like to classify the above damage types into the following categories:

        short blade     stab, pierce
                        this would include knives, daggers etc

        long blade      slash, slice, cleave, chop
                        this would include long swords, short swords, 
                        axes, rapier, sabers etc

        crushing        hit, crush, pound
                        this would include the staff, mace, morning star, 
                        war hammer etc                          

        exotic          whip, suction, vorpal, wail, grep, blast

                        well most of these damage types are pretty bizarre 
                        and close to useless, perhaps we can come up with 
                        some better ones to rename these to. What I imagine 
                        exotic weapons as being are weapons like the whip.                              

        physical        bite, claw, bare handed
                        This is the damage you can do without a weapon, by 
                        biting, clawing and punching / kicking with your 
                        bare hands.             

        Missile         crossbows, longbows etc 
                        there are no specific damage types to really assign 
                        to missile weapons we will need to code it so that 
                        when arrows hit someone they don't actually do one 
                        of the existing damage types, instead doing their 
                        own form of damage. This will likely require us to 
                        have a flag on weapons to allow them to be missile 
                        weapons so that we can ignore the damage type of any 
                        missile weapons when taking into account their weapon 
                        type.
                                                                
        two handed      separate flag for the weapon to take up two hands to 
                        use, can use any of the above damage types really. 
                        Once again we would ignore the damage type and base 
                        the damage etc on the fact that it is a two handed 
                        sword. This would include weapons as a staff, a 
                        two-handed sword, pole arm, pole axe, lance etc


in order for this system to work we need to make sure that each weapon has 
the correct weapon type, we cant have axes the crush for example as the 
damage types is what we will need to base our decisions upon to decide  
if a person is capable of using that weapon.

<A Name="Stances">

<a href="#Top">Back to Top</a> or <a href="#Submit">Submit Feedback</a>
<pre>
We wish to implement (Tim, Nathan and I) a stance system for physical combat
whereby combat is modified based upon the stances of the combatants. This is 
a list of the devised stances:

        Weapon Attack   (Work on destroying your opponent's weapon)
        Patience        (Wait for an opening and exploit it)
        Fury            (All out attack, no holds barred)
        Quick Attack    (Continual quick (yet weak) attacks giving your 
                        opponent no chance to react)
        Circle          (Move around, trying to disrupt opponents rhythm and 
                        get an opening)
        Counter Attack  (Use your opponents strength and imbalance against them)
        Terrain Attack  (Make use of your surroundings to aid you)      

From these stances we have developed the following table of what defeats what:

        Fury beats Weapon
        Fury beats Quick

        Quick beats Terrain
        Quick beats Counter

        Terrain beats Patience
        Terrain beats Circle

        Counter beats Fury
        Counter beats Weapon
        
        Weapon beats Patience
        Weapon beats Terrain

        Patience beats Circle
        Patience beats Counter

        Circle beats Fury
        Circle beats Quick

A bit like rock, paper scissors. Basically certain classes will be able 
to train in the use of the above stances.  These stances are used as your 
stance in combat. You can of course have no stance if you wish, but that 
is not a good idea. Basically if your stance beats your opponents stance 
you get advantages in that fight and they get   disadvantages. ANY stance 
will beat no_stance which is the default and the stance that people without 
access to any stances must fight in or that you fight in if you are 
barehanded.. If you are fighting in the same stance as your opponent or your 
stance is not beaten as displayed above by the stance of your opponent the 
fight will continue as normal with no special affects. Some skills will 
allow players to detect a players stance and to change their stance whilst 
fighting. Other skills will counteract stances altogether (like mounted 
combat). You cannot change your stance mid-fight unless you have the skill
that allows you to.

The system I would like to propose for the learning of magic through
starting off the learning phase at the adept spec is as follows:

In order for one to truly understand and use magic safely and 
properly, I think that they will need INTENSIVE training. Remember 
it was not in the too distant past that people went mad from intuitive 
casting. Magic is something that is very easy to get wrong, and if you 
do get it wrong, the results can be quite catastrophic. Remember the 
time of uncertainty? Basically before magi, wizards, sorcerers and the 
like can use magic to form powerful magical spells they must first have 
a grounding in EACH element.

Why each element? Surely a fire mage should just need to learn the fire 
elemental base and just cast fire magic? I do not believe so, I think 
that when someone attempts to form magic they choose the energy they 
wish to place into the spell. A fire mage would certainly choose fire 
to put into a fireball. However if they do not know much about the 
other elements, and cannot control them correctly, small parts of the 
other potentials may find their way into the spell. This is VERY 
dangerous. The madness is caused by creating a potential imbalance 
within oneself by drawing potentials from ones own self to form 
magic. If you do not understand each potential and how to manipulate 
each potential you are very likely to make a mistake. This is my 
belief anyway.

Having said this, one can learn each potential base as much as they wish, 
but it will still be possible for them to make a mistake which may or 
may not lead to the madness. What I am suggesting is that adepts must 
train in the use of each potential. When they have done so they may 
train the form magic skill which allows them to basically use the cast 
command to cast magic. Like most skills form magic will have a max of 
95%, so it will be possible to fail when you cast a spell. What I would 
like to see implemented is that most of this 5% be simply an 
unsuccessful casting of the spell with various weird and wonderful 
side affects. But I would also like to see a very small chance 
(about 0.05% divided by the casters cognition) of them erring so 
badly in casting the spell as to cause the madness in themselves. 
Perhaps they were careless, or tired or drunk. The madness is a 
very real prospect, ever today. It is rarer only thanks to the 
dedicated work of the ylanthlin to teach young mages properly in the 
use of magic. 

Some may believe that this is a lot of pracs for mages to have to spend 
before they can learn spells. This may be the case, however a lot of the 
spells in the 3rd level specs for mages are VERY powerful. I honestly 
don’t think they are at a disadvantage when they get to the third spec rank.

Mystics do not cast and form magic like the typical mages on Lu’Tamohr. 
Mystics have been around since before people even knew magic, and their 
practice has continued and if anything grown more powerful since the 
advent of the coming. Basically mystics use magic to create their end 
results, but they certainly don’t manipulate the magic as closely or 
even as consciously. The only reason they don’t all turn mad is that 
the magic they create is usually very small and it is well structured 
so that new mystics learning magic have a set procedure by which to 
learn a certain skill which has been handed down through the generations. 
Much of the mystic identity is derived from Rehan culture and history. 
Most experimental mystics eventually turn mad by making a mistake and 
bringing the madness upon themselves.

Poisons

I mention this here because I will soon introduce the concept of skills 
modifying base poisons and advanced poisons. What I would like as a 
poison system is two levels of poisons. The first is "base poisons"
these poisons are no where near as potent as higher level poisons and 
are more easily cured. The second level is "advanced poisons", which 
are more potent and a lot harder to cure.

Crusader

(Death Knights or Paladins)
Crusaders are committed to goals of their own choosing. They are often 
adventures who have trained hard in swordplay, determined to better 
themselves and use their skills to achieve some purpose. Crusaders on 
Lu'Tamohr have causes ranging from freeing slaves, to destroying 
various religious factions. Their dedication and training mark them as 
crusaders.  

It seems as though many people are unhappy with or do not really like 
the idea of the crusader class (I know Tim is one and some of the players). 
I would like all the imms opinions on this. I would like to keep the class 
personally but if the consensus is to drop it then that’s fine. I won’t 
list out the skills I have come up with for a crusader in detail, instead 
I will outline them, and if we decide to keep the class I will provide the 
details. The reason I like crusaders as a class is that it provides a 
powerful warrior class with some magic (like a paladin type person) which 
is nice. Paladins are one of the most played classes in AD&D.

It is obvious I think that the soldier spec has the advantage when 
it comes to leveling as they will be the most powerful when fighting 
one on one. There are some cases where this will not be true, for 
example if the soldier has chosen a poor stance to fight a rogue they 
will gain no advantage and the rogue will actually be dealing more 
damage (through the taunt skill) and taking less damage (using the 
avoid and cunning skills) per round of combat. As you would expect 
it is the rogues and the soldiers which have the best chances in 
fights, they are the most worldly and the most adventurous and 
therefore the most likely to know anything about using weapons and 
combat. Rogues of course gain some nice skills in terms of trail, 
cunning, hide and camouflage.

Labourers are not too bad in combat either with increased strength 
and the ability to use crushing weapons and they possess a number 
of skills that make them very worthwhile. The raw materials skills 
are certainly required for various specs and skills and will increase 
in benefit when a trade system can be implemented. Skills like haul, 
peaceful rest and hardiness also give the labourer some excellent 
advantages as a class.

Students are easily the weakest levelers here and in terms of one on 
one combat they are going to lose every time. But this is balanced a 
little by the feign death command allowing them to avoid confrontation 
in most cases. The availability to students of quick thinking and 
concentrate will certainly benefit them in higher specs as spell 
damage is reliant upon high cognition, and the damage dealt to you by 
spells is reliant on willpower. 
Skills like write, advanced write, transcribe and understanding will 
certainly add a lot to the class and make the class fun to play.

I think each of these rank 1 specs are quite useful and provide a good 
base of skills that are realistic for the type of class they are and 
are not too disjointed in terms of power across the board.

Swordsman, swashbucklers and storm sworders would appear to be the 
most powerful classes in terms of combat damage dealt in a one on one 
situation. Caught by surprise though an archer, a bandit or even a 
farmers stampede can bring them crashing back to earth.

Tailors, smiths and carpenters though not possessing any leveling 
skills will certainly be wealthy and have the ability to shape the 
world a little through their creations which is definitely useful.

Scouts have some useful skills and although they possess no extra 
special combat power they are certainly useful to the game.

Scholars are unlikely to take much damage from mages and possess some 
handy skills to reduce practice costs and increase learning times. They 
will also clearly be the safeguarders of information within the world 
as no one can accurately fool them with fake letters or read their 
important documents.

Adepts though weak in comparison with other rank 2 specs will drastically 
increase in power when they reach the higher level specs.

Mystics and apothecarys have some quite useful skills, but will be more 
powerful when they advance to alchemists, savants or oracles.

Sailors are pretty weak at the moment, I struggled to devise skills for 
them. The only reason I think we should keep them as a spec is that they 
fill a very important niche within our world.

Cutpurses also possess some useful skills and will be able to be an 
interesting class to play.

Minstrels at the moment seem more powerful then storytellers in some 
ways, perhaps these two need to be evened up a bit. They both possess 
some rather handy and powerful skills.

Merchants will be even more influential when we devise a trade system 
but already they will clearly be the money mongols.

I think all the classes will be interesting to play and roleplay within 
the world. Although the warrior type classes will obviously level the 
quickest I don’t think this is a huge problem because it is realistic 
and levels don’t have too much of an impact. And besides the other 
classes can probably level quicker through rp, I for one would certainly 
award fp to a merchant / tailor / scholar / carpenter / smith etc more 
easily then others.

Obviously there are a number of things that still require far more detail, 
thought and discussion amongst the imms even if the general skills that 
use these components are accepted. These include:

        A table of the different mineral ore raw materials and their 
        combinations to form various alloys and metals to be used by 
        the smith class

        A list of the different types of wear locations and armour types 
        that smiths are able to forge using forge armour

        A similar list for forge weapon

        A similar list for the tailor skill sew

        A detailed table of all the herbs / ingredients on Lu’Tamohr and:
                Their affects on their own
                The combinations that create base poisons
                The combinations that create base potions
                The combinations that create advanced poisons
                The combinations that create advanced potions
                The affects (if any) that "harrow" has on the herbs found

        A set of useful and realistic signals for scouts using the 
        signaling command

        A table of all the different gems in the world and the affects they 
        have when applied to objects by an artisan. Also the affect on each 
        gem of the "cut gem" skill and all the negative affects as well as 
        positive (for devaluate).

        A table of the rations provided by each kind of animal corpse

        A list of commands that cannot be seen whilst you are stealthier

        A comprehensive list of skills/spells that can be "chanted"

        A comprehensive list of skills/spells that can be "played"

        A list of spells that can be "dodged"

        A list of wear locations that can be "concealed"

        A comprehensive list of skills/spells that can be "learned"

        List of commands for charmed people

        List of commands for elementals and spirits

        List of commands and mobprogs for hired mobs such as bodyguards, 
        messengers and servants.
